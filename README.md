# sd-webui-modal-overlay

## Description

This plugin enhances the existing modal overlay in the [automatic1111 sd-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) project. It introduces additional controls and layout improvements, designed to be a minimal yet powerful extension to the current web UI.

### Keyboard Controls
  - Toggle the prompt view with the `Up Arrow` key.
  - Save images directly from the modal to a pre-configured directory using the `Down Arrow` key. (Saves to directory configured in "Paths for Saving > Directory" in main settings.)
  - Toggle the visibility of the gallery image count with the `G` key.

## Installation for Automatic1111 Users

1. Start the `webui.bat`.

## Known Issues

When the total number of images generated (calculated as batch size multiplied by the number of batches) is less than during the previous generation, the application's client-side behavior leads to the deletion of the image preview div. This, in turn, removes the previous thumbnails and disables the modal.

Let me know if you find any other issues.

## Versions

### 0.2 - Bug Fix
- Resolved issue where empty prompt would cause modal to crash (now adds 'None' when positive or negative prompt are empty)
